          <p className='text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto'>
            At Anjana Foundation, we believe that meaningful social change is
            possible through collective effort and a commitment to empowering
            the most vulnerable members of society. Our mission is to improve

            services, and opportunities for social and economic empowerment. We
            envision a world where everyone, regardless of their socio-economic
            background, has the tools and resources to realize their full
            potential and contribute meaningfully to society.

                Education is the cornerstone of any sustainable development
                effort. Anjana Foundation focuses on providing access to quality
                education for children and young adults from marginalized

                Access to basic healthcare is a fundamental right, yet it

                medical supplies, prioritizing maternal and child health,
                nutrition, and preventive care.
